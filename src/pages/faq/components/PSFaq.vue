            ParkSpot is a smart parking platform, where you can search and book
            a parking spot at your desired location or in your vicinity.
            ParkSpot also supports long term parking and rental parkings.
            ParkSpot relies on new technology and software that allows you to
            monitor your vehicle in realtime post parking your vehicle in the
            parking spot.

            Why do I need to add my vehicle number at the time of booking? Is it
            safe ?

            We require your vehicle number just to make the post booking process
            more convenient. You dont need to wait for a parking operator to
            just to register your vehicle numbers manually. The systems will
            detect your car when it enter the parking site and from then you'll
            get a video stream to monitor your car We dont share your personal
            details no matter what. We'll keep that our secret.
